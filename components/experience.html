                    As a software engineering intern on the Google Cloud NetApp Volumes team, I worked on the integrating the Google Cloud Console onto the IDE.

                    I also developed a model context protocol server that allows the developer to use a LLM to execute commands and configurations whilst being efficient and optimized per the cloud infrastructure standards.

                <h3>The Psychology of Loading States</h3>
                <div class="date">June 15, 2025</div>
                <p>Those three seconds while your app loads? They're make-or-break moments. How we handle waiting experiences can determine whether users stay engaged or bounce. Here's what I've learned from A/B testing dozens of loading patterns.</p>

                <p>The graveyard of unused apps is vast. After shipping products that nobody used (despite perfect code), I learned that validation beats perfection every time. Start with the problem, not the solution.</p>

                <p>Every feature request feels important when you're in the moment. But the best products aren't defined by what they do—they're defined by what they don't do. Here's my framework for feature decisions that actually matter.</p>

                <p>Working from my home office for the past three years taught me that good code isn't just about functionality—it's about communication. When you can't tap someone on the shoulder, every variable name matters.</p>

                <p>I spent months exploring Vue, Svelte, and solid.js, convinced the grass was greener. Spoiler alert: every framework has trade-offs. Here's why I came back to React and what I learned along the way.</p>
