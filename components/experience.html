                <h3>Why Every Developer Should Learn Design Thinking</h3>
                <div class="date">July 20, 2025</div>
                <p>After years of building products that technically worked but failed to connect with users, I discovered that the best code is written with empathy. Design thinking isn't just for designers—it's a mindset that makes us better problem solvers.</p>

                <h3>The Psychology of Loading States</h3>
                <div class="date">June 15, 2025</div>
                <p>Those three seconds while your app loads? They're make-or-break moments. How we handle waiting experiences can determine whether users stay engaged or bounce. Here's what I've learned from A/B testing dozens of loading patterns.</p>

                <p>The graveyard of unused apps is vast. After shipping products that nobody used (despite perfect code), I learned that validation beats perfection every time. Start with the problem, not the solution.</p>

                <h3>The Art of Saying No to Features</h3>
                <div class="date">May 10, 2025</div>
                <p>Every feature request feels important when you're in the moment. But the best products aren't defined by what they do—they're defined by what they don't do. Here's my framework for feature decisions that actually matter.</p>

                <h3>Remote Work Changed How I Code</h3>
                <div class="date">April 22, 2025</div>
                <p>Working from my home office for the past three years taught me that good code isn't just about functionality—it's about communication. When you can't tap someone on the shoulder, every variable name matters.</p>

                <h3>Why I Switched from React to... More React</h3>
                <div class="date">April 5, 2025</div>
                <p>I spent months exploring Vue, Svelte, and solid.js, convinced the grass was greener. Spoiler alert: every framework has trade-offs. Here's why I came back to React and what I learned along the way.</p>
