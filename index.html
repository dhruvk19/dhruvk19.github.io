                        <h3>Why Every Developer Should Learn Design Thinking</h3>
                        <div class="date">July 20, 2025</div>
                        <p>After years of building products that technically worked but failed to connect with users, I discovered that the best code is written with empathy. Design thinking isn't just for designers—it's a mindset that makes us better problem solvers.</p>

                        <p>Those three seconds while your app loads? They're make-or-break moments. How we handle waiting experiences can determine whether users stay engaged or bounce. Here's what I've learned from A/B testing dozens of loading patterns.</p>

                        <p>The graveyard of unused apps is vast. After shipping products that nobody used (despite perfect code), I learned that validation beats perfection every time. Start with the problem, not the solution.</p>

                        <p>Every feature request feels important when you're in the moment. But the best products aren't defined by what they do—they're defined by what they don't do. Here's my framework for feature decisions that actually matter.</p>

                        <p>Working from my home office for the past three years taught me that good code isn't just about functionality—it's about communication. When you can't tap someone on the shoulder, every variable name matters.</p>

                        <p>I spent months exploring Vue, Svelte, and solid.js, convinced the grass was greener. Spoiler alert: every framework has trade-offs. Here's why I came back to React and what I learned along the way.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Hey there! I'm Alex, a full-stack developer and product designer who gets excited about building things that people actually want to use. Currently based in Austin, Texas, where I spend my days turning complex problems into simple, elegant digital solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">My journey started somewhat accidentally—I was studying economics in college but kept getting distracted by how terribly designed most university websites were. One thing led to another, and I found myself teaching myself HTML and CSS at 2 AM instead of studying for my macro exam. Best life decision ever.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the past eight years, I've had the privilege of working with everyone from anxious startup founders to Fortune 500 executives, helping them translate their wildest ideas into digital products that actually work. I've learned that the best technology is invisible—it just helps people get things done without getting in the way.</p>

                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">You'll find me exploring Austin's food truck scene (current obsession: Korean-Mexican fusion), attempting to keep my houseplants alive (success rate: improving), or disappearing into national parks with my camera and hiking boots.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I'm also slightly obsessed with mechanical keyboards (currently typing on a custom 60% with Cherry MX Blues), pour-over coffee methods, and collecting vinyl records of bands that probably have fewer monthly Spotify listeners than my last app had users.</p>
                        
                        <p>I believe the best products come from diverse teams, honest feedback, and the willingness to throw away your first three ideas because the fourth one is always better. Let's build something amazing together.</p>
